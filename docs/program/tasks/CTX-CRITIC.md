# Task CTX-CRITIC — the critic's prompt paragraph and the tolerant window parse

## Outcome
The critic's prompt explains the reference block and the norm images for runs with a `stage_plan`, and the window path parses tolerantly (`ADR-0029` decision 3).

Owner: the critic lane; deploy while the v3 queue is empty.

## Depends on
- CTX-STAND

Dispatch the lane only when every task above is merged into the base it works from.

## Frozen inputs
- domain contract: 1.49.0 at the base; 1.50.0 once the AR v3 removal wave merges (`R-154h`)
- API contract: 1.49.0 at the base; 1.50.0 once the AR v3 removal wave merges (`R-154h`)
- analysis/comparison/event contract: 1.49.0 at the base; 1.50.0 once the AR v3 removal wave merges (`R-154h`)
- migration head: `0062_hosts_stage_models` at the base; `0063` once the AR v3 removal wave merges (`R-154h`)
- the seals: the first seal of this programme is 1.51.0 / `0064` (`R-154h`: the AR v3 removal wave takes 1.50.0 / `0063` first); the second is 1.52.0 / `0065` (`R-154h`)
- base commit: `47c90e1ec6adf160f788e69279819c0e9c048e8e`
- ADR: `ADR-0029` decision 3; plan section 3.5
- `analysis/extended/review.py` is part of the rules digest: the change moves `rules_sha256` of every v3 run, and queued runs refuse with `extended_rules_changed_requires_consent`
- plan: the «Прецеденты» plan (version 5, with the R-154 correction) is the integrator's working copy `.local/evidence/lane-common-prec/plan-v5.md` and is not in git; the decisions it carries are in `ADR-0029`
- rules: the common rules of the programme (`.local/evidence/lane-common-prec-2026-11-10.md`, git-ignored): minimal checks only, tests under the host lock, no push, merge or tag
- the plan read the code at `5342b7178`, which has the same code as the base; every `path:line` the lane relies on is checked in its own worktree before use

## Enumerator ownership
- enumerated_set_changed: no
- enumerator_path: not_applicable
- enumerator_owner: not_applicable
- totality_query: not_applicable

## Captured premise evidence
- premise: none

## Historical evidence
- correction_mode: none
- source_record: not_applicable
- addendum_path: not_applicable

## Publication authority
- development_target: origin/dev
- origin_main_authority: none

## Allowed paths
- `src/auditmanager/analysis/extended/review.py`
- `src/auditmanager/runs/extended_review.py`
- `tests/unit/analysis_extended/**`

## Forbidden hotspots
- `contracts/**` and `db/migrations/**`, unless the lane owns them below
- `src/auditmanager/bootstrap/composition.py` and `src/auditmanager/bootstrap/adapters.py`, unless the lane owns them below
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `web/package-lock.json`, `web/src/app/globals.css`
- `VERSION` and `release-notes/**`, unless the lane owns them below
- the historical records `docs/program/tasks/**` (except the new task files of `CRIT-ADR-29`) and `docs/manual-tests/**`
- any path outside `Allowed paths`; a path a lane needs and lacks is named in its report, not taken

## Non-goals
- no change to the legacy prompt

## Deliverables
- a paragraph about the reference section and the norm images, only for runs with a `stage_plan`, replacing the sentence «Изображения здесь повторно не приложены»
- the strict window path `_review_window_v3` moves to `rejected=` like the batch path, so a quote from the reference costs one row, not the whole paid answer

## Required tests
- command: .venv/bin/python -m pytest -c pyproject.toml --rootdir=. -q -p no:cacheprovider <the test files named above>
- expected: pass; each check below can fail, and a lane shows the test that proves it can
- the legacy prompt text is byte-for-byte unchanged
- a quote from the reference rejects a row, not the answer
- the rules digest changed (expected)

## Integration contract
Deploy only when the v3 queue is empty or with a re-consent note.

## Failure/idempotency/security cases
- a model that echoes the reference cannot fail the whole answer

## Rollback / feature flag
The switch and the earlier rules (a new consent).

## Handoff
- changed files: `git diff --stat <base>..HEAD` and a proof that the forbidden hotspots are untouched
- commands/results: each check with its exact command, the tree SHA and the counts; «not run» with the reason
- known limits: stated, with `path:line` evidence for any departure from the plan
- integration notes: what the integrator must do next
