# Task PAUSE-WEB-01 — one «Пауза» button with the items «Выдача анализа» and «Векторы»

## Outcome
The top strip has one pause button with two items; the badge «Векторы на паузе» exists only during a pause (`ADR-0029` decision 8).

Owner: the web lane.

## Depends on
- CRIT-SEAL-50

Dispatch the lane only when every task above is merged into the base it works from.

## Frozen inputs
- domain contract: 1.49.0, unchanged until the seal
- API contract: 1.49.0, unchanged until the seal
- analysis/comparison/event contract: 1.49.0, unchanged until the seal
- migration head: `0062_hosts_stage_models`, unchanged until the seal
- the seal: 1.50.0 / `0063`, or the next free numbers if the AR v3 removal wave merges first
- base commit: `47c90e1ec6adf160f788e69279819c0e9c048e8e`
- ADR: `ADR-0029` decision 8; `R-153f` (UI minimisation: count concepts before and after)
- plan: the «Прецеденты» plan (version 5, with the R-154 correction) is the integrator's working copy `.local/evidence/lane-common-prec/plan-v5.md` and is not in git; the decisions it carries are in `ADR-0029`
- rules: the common rules of the programme (`.local/evidence/lane-common-prec-2026-11-10.md`, git-ignored): minimal checks only, tests under the host lock, no push, merge or tag
- the plan read the code at `5342b7178`, which has the same code as the base; every `path:line` the lane relies on is checked in its own worktree before use

## Enumerator ownership
- enumerated_set_changed: no
- enumerator_path: not_applicable
- enumerator_owner: not_applicable
- totality_query: not_applicable

## Captured premise evidence
- premise: none

## Historical evidence
- correction_mode: none
- source_record: not_applicable
- addendum_path: not_applicable

## Publication authority
- development_target: origin/dev
- origin_main_authority: none

## Allowed paths
- `web/src/widgets/pause-status/**`
- `web/src/features/pause-execution/**`
- `web/src/entities/execution/**`
- `web/tests/unit/execution/**`

## Forbidden hotspots
- `contracts/**` and `db/migrations/**`, unless the lane owns them below
- `src/auditmanager/bootstrap/composition.py` and `src/auditmanager/bootstrap/adapters.py`, unless the lane owns them below
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `web/package-lock.json`, `web/src/app/globals.css`
- `VERSION` and `release-notes/**`, unless the lane owns them below
- the historical records `docs/program/tasks/**` (except the new task files of `CRIT-ADR-29`) and `docs/manual-tests/**`
- any path outside `Allowed paths`; a path a lane needs and lacks is named in its report, not taken

## Non-goals
- no second button
- no badge outside a pause

## Deliverables
- the menu of two items on the existing button; the badge during a vector pause only; the concept count before and after

## Required tests
- command: from `web/`: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=1 <files>`, `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` and `npx eslint <files>`
- expected: pass; each check below can fail, and a lane shows the test that proves it can
- no badge without a pause
- the viewer role does not see the button
- one button, not two

## Integration contract
Uses `getVectorControl` and `setVectorPaused` from the seal; the stand side is `EMBED-01`.

## Failure/idempotency/security cases
- the button is not shown to a role that cannot use it

## Rollback / feature flag
Restore the widget.

## Handoff
- changed files: `git diff --stat <base>..HEAD` and a proof that the forbidden hotspots are untouched
- commands/results: each check with its exact command, the tree SHA and the counts; «not run» with the reason
- known limits: stated, with `path:line` evidence for any departure from the plan
- integration notes: what the integrator must do next
- visible change: a preview in light and dark at 1280 and 390 px with DOM facts under `.local/reports/<lane>-2026-11-10/`; the lane reports the paths and stops, and the commit of visual changes waits for the owner
